# Types

### Float

In python we have only one type for decimal values. 

``` python 
float
```

But in C language

We have two type, single-precision floating point number (32 bit) and double-precision floating point number (64 bit). only different in binary representation.

``` C
float  
double 

```

#### It is usually recommended to use double in order to attain higher precisions and accuracy.
