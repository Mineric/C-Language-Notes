# Types

### Float

In python we have only one type for decimal values. 

``` python 
float
```

But in C language

We have two type, single-precision floating point number (32 bit) and double-precision floating point number (64 bit). only different in binary representation.

``` C
float  
double 

```

#### It is usually recommended to use double in order to attain higher precisions and accuracy.

double (%lf)
float (%f)

``` C 

float x = 0.5;
double y = 0.5;

scanf("%f \n", x);
scanf("%lf \n", y);

```
